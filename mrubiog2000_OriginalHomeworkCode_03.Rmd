## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
library(curl)

f <- f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall21/zombies.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
d
head(d)

```

QUESTION 1

```{r}
summary(d) #With "summary()" I can see the mean of every quantitative value from the whole population.

attach(d) #Used to be able to call the variables from the data frame.
names(d) #To see the names of the columns (variables) I need to work with.
mean(age) #Another way to do it If wanted to see the mean from a specific column (variable).

ssq <- function(x) {sum((x-mean(x))^2)} #Function to calculate the sum of squares.
pop_var <- function(x) {ssq(x)/length(x)} #Function to calculate the variance of the population (note it is divided by "n" instead of by "n-1")
pop_sd <- function(x) {sqrt(pop_var(x))} #Function to calculate the standard deviation of the population.

pop_sd(height)
pop_sd(weight)
pop_sd(zombies_killed)
pop_sd(years_of_education)
pop_sd(age)

#I have calculate the standard deviation of each numeric parameter of the population with the function above. I do not know if there is any function/way to directly apply a function only to numeric values from a data frame, so I did it individually.

```

QUESTION 2

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra) #Package that allows drawing multiple ggplot plots

weight_plot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = weight)) + geom_boxplot()
height_plot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = height)) + geom_boxplot()
zombies_plot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = zombies_killed)) + geom_boxplot()
yearsedu_plot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = years_of_education)) + geom_boxplot()
age_plot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = gender, y = age)) + geom_boxplot()

#Boxplots with gender (x axis) and quantitative variables (y axis)

grid.arrange(weight_plot, height_plot, zombies_plot, yearsedu_plot, age_plot, ncol=3)

#function used to draw multiple plots ("par()" function did not work).

```

```{r}
#This is an idea I tried first but did not work. Anyways, I think the structure may be useful (selecting only "female" and "male" data from the data frame).

fem <- d[grep("^[Female]", d$gender), ] 
male <- d[grep("^[Male]", d$gender), ] 


#I have selected and separated from the data frame "d" the individuals whose gender is "female" and "male". I tried at first without the "^" but it did not work so I wrote it although I do not know what does it exactly do.
```

QUESTION 3

```{r}

age_height_plot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = age, y = height), color = cyl) + geom_point()

age_weight_plot <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = age, y = weight), color = cyl) + geom_point()

grid.arrange(age_height_plot, age_weight_plot, ncol = 2)

#These variables (age-height, age-weight) might be related in a proportional way (they in/decrease at the same time), but in the age-weight plot there is more dispersion. Anyways, I do not know if there is a way to calculate "R^2" in R

```

QUESTION 4
